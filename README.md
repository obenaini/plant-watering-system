# plant-watering-system
This is a prject done with an arduino board. The goal of this project is to water a plant automatically when the moisture in the soil is below a certain threshold.
The arduino board will pump water into the soil until the moisture level rises beyond the threshold, then it will stop until the soil dries up again.
